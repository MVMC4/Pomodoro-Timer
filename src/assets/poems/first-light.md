# First LIght


You arrived like morning
gradual, then all at once,
turning everything warm.

slowly seeping through the veil of night,
then bursting forth in a cascade of golden light,
infusing the world with an unexpected warmth.
In this personal embrace of day's beginning,

the heart stirs from its slumber,
finding romance in the subtle shift from shadow to illumination,
as if the sun itself conspires to melt the night's lingering frost.
The ice that encases the soul during darker hours begins to fracture,

revealing the tender vulnerability beneath,
a romantic thawing that mirrors the earth's renewal.
Seasons align in this symphony of light,
from the hesitant blush of spring mornings to the bold blaze of summer dawns,

each one a testament to the power of gradual transformation.
The spirit, bathed in this radiant arrival,
feels the stirrings of inner fire,
kindled not by external forces,

but by the quiet magic of personal rebirth,
where every ray pierces the cold barriers,
turning the landscape of emotion into a blooming paradise of warmth and possibility.
