# Margins

I wrote this
in the space
between thoughts.

Every flicker of every word,
on the thought of what could have been,
feels like frostbite on my heart.

The winter chill
eats away at my soul,
slow and merciless.

Yet I still yearn
for the warmth
it once gave me,
the quiet heat of belonging,
the illusion of permanence.

I linger there,
lucid in memory,
aware of what once was
and what will never return.

Time presses its margins tighter,
and I write smaller,
trying to fit the ache
between the lines.

Still, I write.
Because even in the cold,
even as feelings numb,
there is proof I was here,
and that once,
I felt something worth freezing for.
