# Hours

What feels like hours,
seconds slip by.

Thoughts pace through my brain,
every second of every day.
I wish I could exaggerate,
say, “Oh, I think of you all the time,”
as a whim,
a passing white lie,
something said only for flattery.

But it isn’t that.

I truly do.
And it truly hurts.

I toss and turn in my bed,
curl up in a ball,
hands pressed against my ears,
as if to silence the thoughts,
but they only creep in louder.

Only thoughts of hope,
of what might be,
can quell the ringing
and thaw the frost in my heart.
