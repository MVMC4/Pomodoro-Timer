# Quiet

like I stare blankly at the phone screen,
hoping for a message that never comes,
or in another corner my chest hammers
at a vibration that isn’t yours

like every second stretches,
and the glow of the screen
feels louder than any sound,
and still nothing

like I scroll past the same old notifications,
my thumb hovering,
half afraid, half wishing
that one of them is you

like quiet is a thing that hurts,
a pause so loud
it fills the room
and presses against my ribs
