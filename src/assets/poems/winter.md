# Winter

I yearn for the painful chill of winter,
For the frost to cover me, 
for it once embraced me in warmth,
A warmth I crave,
Now turned cold.
But the yearning for that feeling of familiarity pulls me closer,
Knowing I will only get hurt the more I push for it.
Yet my heart is frozen still, at a point in time when all was fine,
When the worries were dull, 
now I can only cling to that feeling.
